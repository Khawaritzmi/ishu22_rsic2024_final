\section{System Architecture}
Sample paragraph: The system architecture is designed to support real-time face recognition for multiple students. It consists of a camera module, a preprocessing unit, and a face recognition model, all of which integrate seamlessly for efficient attendance marking.

\section{System Workflow}
Sample paragraph: The workflow begins with the camera capturing an image, followed by preprocessing, which includes resizing and normalization. The preprocessed image is then fed into the recognition model, which identifies students and logs their attendance.
