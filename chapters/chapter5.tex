\section{Implementation}
Sample paragraph: Implementation involves the integration of several key components, including image capture, face detection, and attendance logging. Using TensorFlow and OpenCV, the face recognition model is embedded within the application for real-time processing.

\section{Results and Discussion}
Sample paragraph: The results indicate that the model achieves high accuracy in well-lit conditions but encounters challenges in low-light environments. The discussion section provides an analysis of these findings and explores potential improvements.

\section{Conclusion}
Sample paragraph: This project successfully demonstrates the potential of face recognition for attendance systems. Although the system performs well, future work could focus on improving accuracy in challenging environments, such as poor lighting or complex backgrounds.
